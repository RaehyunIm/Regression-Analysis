# NYC AirBnB Rental Price Predcition Regression Analysis
Prediction of price for Airbnb hosts in New York City. 
# Introduction

Since its launch in 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

The dataset includes variety of types and nature of feature information that allows to make prediction and draw conclusions.

# Objectives 

In this project, we are disposed to utilize given information of Airbnb listing to excercise Regression machine learning model analysis in order to make prediction on price, which is the target or response of the dataset. By taking into consideration, we set our objective to:

- Cleaning and manipulating dataset to be easily interpretable and to accomodate into machine algorithms for prediction analysis in the future
- Analyze relationship that each features have with listing price, target or response to streamline model's capacity in price prediction
